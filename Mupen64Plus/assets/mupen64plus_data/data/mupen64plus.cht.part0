Cheat26="Beta Bottles Revenge Mode",801255C2 0001,80080881 0002
Cheat26_N=Bottles Revenge is a Beta mode from Banjo Tooie that the RWP team recently uncovered after an extraordinary amount of effort. Bottles the Spirit transforms into Bottles the Devil and posses enemies nearby and allows a second player hooked up to Pad 2 to play as that Posses character to try to foil Banjos Plans. As player one goes about its business, player two uses every enemy nearby to try to nab Banjo and take away some life. This mode is incredible, and you can control almost every enemy in the game: slot machines, flying creatures, uggers, zubbas...and this is just the beginning. (Congrats Rare Witch Project)

Cheat61_N=If you go to an area where Link is immobile or invisible, using the "appear in strange places" code will almost always fix it, but you'll start somewhere outside of the Arena and in air.

Cheat62_O=$00 Off,$01 On
Cheat62_N=If you go to an area where the interface is accessible, this signigfies that you're not in 'beta' mode anymore. Using the "interface always off/on" code, you can stay in 'beta' mode regardless of what happens. This may cause more crashes in SOME areas, but it's rare and is not too severe. If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game. If you need the interface on/off at a specific time, start the game, go to the area, activate the code, keep it on until next reset.

Cheat31="Beta Bottles Revenge Mode",8012B3F2 0001,800810C1 0002
Cheat31_N=Bottles Revenge is a Beta mode from Banjo Tooie that the RWP team recently uncovered after an extraordinary amount of effort. Bottles the Spirit transforms into Bottles the Devil and posses enemies nearby and allows a second player hooked up to Pad 2 to play as that Posses character to try to foil Banjos Plans. As player one goes about its business, player two uses every enemy nearby to try to nab Banjo and take away some life. This mode is incredible, and you can control almost every enemy in the game: slot machines, flying creatures, uggers, zubbas...and this is just the beginning. (Congrats Rare Witch Project)

Cheat61_N=If you go to an area where Link is immobile or invisible, using the "appear in strange places" code will almost always fix it, but you'll start somewhere outside of the Arena and in air. I recommend using the infinite step Hover boots code already supplied with PJ64 so you can float back into the arena in the event that this happens.

Cheat62_O=$00 Off,$01 On
Cheat62_N=If you go to an area where the interface is accessible, this signigfies that you're not in 'beta' mode anymore. Using the "interface always off/on" code, you can stay in 'beta' mode regardless of what happens. This may cause more crashes in SOME areas, but it's rare and is not too severe. If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game. If you need the interface on/off at a specific time, start the game, go to the area, activate the code, keep it on until next reset.
