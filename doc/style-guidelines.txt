******************************************
RECOMMENDED LOOK-FEEL AND CODING PRACTICES
******************************************
Wherever possible, provide design guidance and recommendations directly in the
source code header comments, rather than in a central file like this, which may
be overlooked by new contributors.  In this file, add new sections that simply
point to the source file where guidance is provided.  Do not duplicate guidance
documentation here, as this would create a maintenance chore.  Any references
or web links that inspire or justify the design choices should be noted in the
header comments.  Such links and references may be copied to the bottom of this
file as a convenience to the reader.
